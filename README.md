## 🔥 Wildfire Hazard Model Evaluation

Independent statistical review of Oregon’s statewide wildfire hazard framework.

**Project Focus**
- Percentile threshold validation  
- Fire activity classification testing  
- Geographic risk assignment consistency  
- Model transparency and reproducibility  

**Impact**
This analysis identified material inconsistencies between reported percentile thresholds and empirical distributions, as well as classification failures in historically burned regions.  
The findings contributed to public scrutiny and legislative reconsideration of the statewide hazard framework.
